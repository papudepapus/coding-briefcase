# Programming Toolkit

The Programming Toolkit is a React application that serves as a comprehensive resource for programmers. It provides sections to showcase your navigation menu, a banner, your technical skills, projects you've worked on, and a contact formâ€”all wrapped up with a clean, modern footer.

## Project Structure

The main structure of the application is defined in the `App.js` file, which imports and renders the following components:

- **NavBar**: The main navigation bar that contains links to various sections.
- **Banner**: A welcoming section that highlights the vision behind the toolkit.
- **Skills**: A section displaying the technical skills and tools you use.
- **Projects**: A gallery-like component showcasing your projects.
- **Contact**: A form or contact information for visitors to reach out.
- **Footer**: Contains additional links and information.
